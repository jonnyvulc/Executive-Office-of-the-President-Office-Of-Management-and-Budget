EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503

MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES
FROM: Mick Mulvaney Director
SUBJECT: Reducing Burden for Federal Agencies by Rescinding and Modifying OMB Memoranda
From administration to administration, agencies have been asked to respond to hundreds of guidance documents related to management areas such as information technology (IT), human capital, acquisition, financial management, and real property. Too often, burdensome tasks have piled up without consideration of whether the requirements collectively make sense. In many cases, agencies are asked to spend more time and resources complying with low-value activities versus allocating taxpayer dollars to meet their core agency mission.
In support of the President’s Management Agenda and the belief that the Federal Government can – and should – operate more effectively and efficiently, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is taking action to identify low-value, duplicative, and obsolete activities that can be ended. Through this Memorandum, OMB begins providing relief to agencies by rolling back these requirements and allowing those who know their agencies best – agency managers – manage operations, adopt best practices, and find the best way possible to reduce costs and minimize staff hours responding to duplicative and burdensome reporting requirements.
This is just the first phase of an extensive review process. Over the next year, the Administration will:
• Continue working with agencies through the government-wide council structure to identify additional areas of low-value, duplicative, and obsolete requirements, including those that are statutory in nature, and work with the appropriate parties, including the Legislative Branch, to provide relief for agencies wherever possible.
• Coordinate with the Federal government’s other central management offices and agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the General Services Administration (GSA), to identify and reduce or eliminate burdensome, low-value compliance activities.
• Examine the processes by which OMB issues management guidance to agencies to determine where processes may be streamlined and better coordinated, and that critical document management practices, such as the addition of sunset provisions, are added to the issuance process.
• Develop a long-term solution for reviewing and rescinding guidance, as well as locating our guidance documents in a portal that agencies can easily access.
Consistent with the requirements in OMB Memorandum M-17-22, Comprehensive Plan for Reforming the Federal Government and Reducing the Federal Civilian Workforce, to identify initial burden reduction opportunities within 60 days of issuance, this Memorandum rescinds, modifies, and/or pauses the following previously issued OMB memoranda to alleviate reporting and compliance burdens and allow agencies to
 1

focus their efforts on higher value activities.1 Below is a description of the OMB guidance documents affected by this Memorandum, categorized by type of action (i.e., eliminated, modified, paused) and area of focus (i.e., information technology, financial management, procurement, performance management, customer service, program management). Additionally, the Appendix to this Memorandum contains a summary listing of each OMB guidance document referenced and discussed below.
Eliminated – Information Technology:
IT Security - M-99-20, M-02-12, M-03-19, M-07-11, and Updated Instructions for Public Reporting of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12: These five IT security memoranda are outdated because they were issued prior to the enactment of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA 2014) and many of the requirements therein have been superseded by subsequent OMB policy and guidance. OMB is formally rescinding these memos to ensure agencies will continue to implement the requirements FISMA 2014 and related guidance.
• M-99-20, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources (June 23, 1999)
• M-02-12, Reducing Redundant IT Infrastructure Related to Homeland Security (July 19, 2002)
• M-03-19, Reporting Instructions for the Federal Information Security Management Act and
Updated Guidance on Quarterly IT Security Reporting (August 6, 2003)
• M-07-11, Implementation of Commonly Accepted Security Configurations for Windows Operating
Systems (March 22, 2007)
• Updated Instructions for Public Reporting of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD
12) Implementation Status (October 26, 2007)
IT Asset Management and Agency Oversight - M-97-12, M-03-14, M-10-25, M-10-31, and M-15-10: These five OMB memoranda set guidance for the management and oversight of Federal agency IT portfolios and assets. These instructions and reporting requirements are already implemented through various other OMB efforts, such as the quarterly OMB Integrated Data Collection (IDC) and updated OMB memoranda. OMB is formally rescinding these memos. Agencies should continue to implement IT management priorities as identified by the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and related OMB memoranda and guidance.
• M-97-12, Evaluation of Agency Implementation of Capital Planning and Investment Control Processes (April 25, 1997)
• M-03-14, Reducing Cost and Improving Quality in Federal Purchases of Commercial Software (June 2, 2003)

• M-10-31, Immediate Review of Information Technology Projects (July 28, 2010)
• M-15-10, Focusing on Implementation to Drive Improvements (April 6, 2015)
1 In addition to the OMB guidance documents identified for rescission or modification in this Memorandum, OMB is finalizing updates to Appendix C of OMB Circular A-123 (2014) and OMB Circular A-136, Financial Reporting Requirements (2016) that will streamline and simplify payment integrity guidance and agency financial reporting. These updates will not only reduce the staff hours spent responding to duplicative and unnecessary reporting requirements but also render obsolete several OMB guidance documents, such as OMB Memoranda M-12-11 (Reducing Improper Payments through the “Do Not Pay List”), M-13-20 (Protecting Privacy while Reducing Improper Payments with the Do Not Pay Initiative), and M-15-02 (Appendix C to Circular No. A-123, Requirements for Effective Estimation and Remediation of Improper Payments).

Eliminated – Information Technology (Cont.):
IT Management and Planning - M-97-16, M-02-08, M-08-26, M-09-02, M-11-17, and M-11-29: These six OMB memoranda set guidance for the procurement, management, and oversight of Federal agency IT portfolios and assets. OMB is rescinding these memoranda to provide clarity and reduce the implementation burden on Federal agencies for IT-related initiatives. Agencies should continue to implement IT management priorities as identified by FITARA and related OMB memoranda and guidance.
• M-97-16, Information Technology Architectures (June 18, 1997)
• M-02-08, Redundant Information Systems Relating to On-Line Rulemaking Initiative (May 6,
2002)
• M-08-26, Transition from FTS2001 to Networx (August 28, 2008)

• M-11-29, Chief Information Officer Authorities (August 8, 2011)
Government Information Security Reform Act Guidance – M-01-08 and M-01-24: These two OMB memoranda set agency implementation requirements to meet the goals of the Government Information Security Reform Act (GISRA). Since passage of this legislation, the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA 2002) was enacted by Congress in 2002 and subsequently revised by FISMA 2014. FISMA 2002 and, subsequently, FISMA 2014 superseded the requirements of GISRA, and OMB has issued updated guidance for agency implementation of FISMA 2014, including M-16-04: Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan (CSIP) for the Federal Civilian Government, and annual guidance to meet the reporting requirements of the law. Federal agencies should utilize all appropriate FISMA 2014 cybersecurity guidance from OMB in place of these two policies.
• M-01-08, Guidance on Implementing the Government Information Security Reform Act (January 16, 2001)
• M-01-24, Reporting Instructions for the Government Information Security Reform Act (June 22, 2001)
Year 2000 Memos – M-99-09, M-99-12, M-99-15, M-99-16, M-99-17, M-99-21, and M-00-01: All seven of these policies set out requirements and implementation guidance for agencies on planning for potential IT disruption related to the Year 2000. These policies are now obsolete and outdated, as the Federal government was successfully unaffected by any service interruptions. As a result, OMB is rescinding these memoranda because the deadlines for implementation have passed.
• M-99-09, Revised Reporting Guidance on Year 2000 Efforts (January 26, 1999)

                3

Eliminated – Information Technology (Cont.):
Annual FISMA Guidance: M-04-24, M-05-15, M-06-20, M-07-19, M-08-21, M-09-29, and M-10-15: These seven IT security memoranda are outdated and many of the requirements therein have been superseded by subsequent OMB guidance. OMB is formally rescinding these memos to ensure agencies will continue to implement the requirements of updated guidance related to fiscal year (FY) reporting under FISMA 2014.
• M-04-25: FY 2004 Reporting Instructions for the Federal Information Security Management Act (August 23, 2004)

• M-10-15: FY 2010 Reporting Instructions for the Federal Information Security Management Act and Agency Privacy Management (April 21, 2010)
Proposed Partial Elimination Conditioned on Enactment of Appropriations Legislation for FY 2018 – Financial Management:
Reporting Related to Efficient Spending to Support Agency Operations - M-12-12 and M-17-08: The current process to review, approve, and publicly report on Federally-sponsored and Federally-hosted conferences have become incredibly burdensome for agencies. Management of the conference approval process must instead evolve to a more risk-based approach in which agencies apply the enterprise risk management and internal control practices set forth in OMB Circular A-123 to ensure that Federal funds are spent appropriately. Therefore, OMB proposes to amend in part Memoranda M-12-12 and M-17-08, following the enactment of appropriations legislation for FY 2018 that repeals section 523 of division H and section 739 of division E of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (Public Law 115-31), consistent with the President’s Budget for FY 2018. If the proposed appropriations language is enacted, then agencies may forego the conference approval process and public reporting requirements imposed by these memoranda.
• M-12-12, Promoting Efficient Spending to Support Agency Operations (May 2012)
• M-17-08, Amending OMB Memorandum M-12-12, Promoting Efficient Spending to Support
Agency Operations (November 2016) Eliminated – Financial Management:
Grants Management Related Requirements - M-14-17, M-12-01, and OMB’s Controller Alert of December 2016: To help reduce the burden for grants management related requirements, agencies are no longer required to: 1) report the metrics measuring the impact of the Uniform Guidance (2 C.F.R. Part 200), as instructed by OMB Memorandum M-14-17, and 2) prepare for an expanded Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance numbering schematic, as informed by OMB’s Controller Alert of December 2016. In addition, the Council on Financial Assistance Reform (COFAR), an interagency group of Executive Branch
                4

Eliminated – Financial Management (Cont.):
officials that was established by OMB Memorandum M-12-01, is disbanded. Moving forward, financial assistance priorities will be considered by the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Council, consistent with the goal of involving a broader community of grant-making agencies to participate in developing priorities for reforming Federal grants management.
• M-14-17, Metrics for Uniform Guidance (2 C.F.R. 200) (September 2014)
• M-12-01, Creation of the Council on Financial Assistance Reform (October 2011)
• Controller Alert, Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Numbering Schematic (December 2016)
Accelerated Payment Reporting – M-12-16, M-13-15, M-14-10, M-16-07, and M-17-13: Agency quarterly progress reporting to OMB, as originally required by OMB Memorandum M-12-16 and subsequently extended by OMB Memoranda M-13-15, M-14-10, M-16-07 and M-17-13, is eliminated. Agencies are encouraged to continue to accelerate payments, to the best of their ability, to small businesses and prime contractors with small business subcontractors. This reporting requirement change, however, does not affect an agency’s responsibilities to comply with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. Chapter 39) and OMB’s implementing regulations thereto (5 C.F.R. Part 1315).
• M-12-16, Providing Prompt Payment to Small Business Subcontractors (July 2012)
• M-13-15, Extension of Policy to Provide Accelerated Payment to Small Business Subcontractors
(July 2013)
• M-14-10, Extension of Policy to Provide Accelerated Payment to Small Business Subcontractors
(July 2014)
• M-16-07, Reporting of Accelerated Payment to Small Business Subcontractors (March 2016)
• M-17-13, Extension of Policy to Provide Accelerated Payment to Small Businesses and Small
Business Subcontractors (January 2017)
Reporting of Conference Spending – M-11-35: Agency reporting of conference expenses to OMB is eliminated because agencies have satisfied the one-time data call requirement. Agencies should continue to apply enterprise risk management and internal control practices set forth in OMB Circular A-123 to their conference approval process to ensure that Federal funds are spent appropriately.
• M-11-35, Eliminating Excess Conference Spending and Promoting Efficiency in Government (September 2011)
Reporting Costs Related to the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill – M-10-29, M-11-09, Management Procedures Memorandum (MPM) 2010-35, and MPM 2012-03: Agency data collection requirements for identifying and documenting government costs related to the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill are eliminated because a key purpose for tracking and collecting such data has been obviated with the settlement of related litigation.
• M-10-29, Identifying and Documenting Costs of Government Activities Related to the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill (July 2010)
• M-11-09, Supplemental Guidance on Reporting Costs of Government Activities Related to the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill (January 2011)

• MPM 2012-03, Amended Reporting Guidelines for Reporting Costs of Government Activities Related to the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill (October 2012)
           5

Eliminated – Procurement:
Implementation Guidance for Executive Order (EO) 13502 on Use of Project Labor Agreements for Federal Construction Projects – Implementation guidance for this EO requires agencies to submit quarterly reports to OMB identifying all contracts awarded in connection with large-scale construction projects (i.e., projects over $25 million) as well as information on the consideration and use of project labor agreements. The reporting requirement on the use of project labor agreements is eliminated.
Improving the Collection and Use of Information about Contractor Performance and Integrity, March 6, 2013 – This guidance requires agencies to improve the collection and use of performance information by, among other things, setting a 100% target for reporting past performance on awards above the simplified acquisition threshold. Emphasizing the quality of a contractor’s past performance in future award decisions is an important tool for holding contractors accountable to the taxpayer and making sure the government receives good value from its contracts. However, to ensure agencies’ efforts are focused on using this tool as an incentive to achieve successful performance outcomes, and not on rigid compliance with meeting a goal, OMB is eliminating the reporting target. OMB will work with agencies on more efficient and effective management strategies addressing the use of past performance information, especially for the highest risk, complex actions.
Eliminated – Performance Management:
OMB Memorandum M-16-08, Establishment of the Core Federal Services Council (March 30, 2016) ­ Senior representatives from each of the programs identified in M-16-08 will no longer be required to attend quarterly meetings of the Core Federal Services Council (CFSC), which was established to improve the customer experience of major Federal programs that provide transactional services directly to the public. While improving the customer service that the Federal government provides is still a priority of this Administration, OMB does not believe that the existing council is an effective mechanism to achieve this goal given the limited impact the CFSC has had in improving the customer experience of core Federal programs. In lieu of the CFSC, program and project management will be carried out in accordance with the Program Management Improvement Accountability Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1126, to develop Federal government- wide standards, practices, and metrics derived from proven program management principles to ensure improvements in services for citizens and businesses.
Modified – Information Technology:
M-14-08, Fiscal Year 2014 PortfolioStat (OMB, May 2014) describes reporting requirements and provides implementation guidance to federal agencies about PortfolioStat, a process to provide data-driven review of agency’s IT portfolio. While agencies are still required to participate in PortfolioStat, the outdated benchmarking requirements from M-14-08 are no longer needed. Therefore, OMB is eliminating these reporting requirements in the Integrated Data Collection Tool.
Modified – Procurement:
Streamlining of Business Case Process – Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Memorandum, Development, Review and Approval of Business Cases for Certain Interagency and Agency-Specific Acquisitions (September 29, 2011), requires agencies to develop business cases when creating or renewing certain inter-agency and agency-specific contracts to optimize the use of existing contracts and reduce duplication. To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of this process and minimize unnecessary burden for agencies, OMB will pilot a new streamlined process consisting of the following steps that will replace the process required by the September 2011 memorandum:
     6

Modified – Procurement (Cont.):
1. Informed Analysis – During the early development of an acquisition plan for a procurement of $50 million, or such other threshold as identified by OMB, that may significantly overlap an existing government-wide acquisition contract, Federal Strategic Sourcing contract or agreement, best-in-class contract, or any other contract or vehicle identified by OMB, the agency will review relevant performance and pricing information on the Federal Acquisition Gateway on existing contracts.
2. Upfront Engagement - If the agency concludes, after reviewing the performance and pricing information, that use of an existing contract would not be suitable (e.g., the agency believes it can negotiate better pricing or terms and conditions), or the agency believes the information is not sufficient to make a suitability determination, the agency will explain its position using a template furnished by OMB.
3. Facilitated Collaboration – OMB will share the agency’s explanation with the relevant Federal Category Manager and any other appropriate officials and facilitate discussion on the agency’s evaluation.
4. Optimization of Results – If an existing vehicle, as identified in paragraph 1, is not used, the agency will:
a) issue a policy for agency-wide mandatory use of its agency-specific contract. If mandatory use is not practicable, the agency will establish enumerated exceptions.
b) provide: 1) prices paid and performance information on the Prices Paid Portal and Acquisition Gateway; 2) agency spend compliance and savings, and 3) other information as requested by OMB.
The pilot will begin on August 1, 2017, before which OFPP will provide additional information on the pilot, including a template that agencies may use to develop their streamlined business cases. By March 1, 2019, OMB will evaluate pilot results, with appropriate stakeholder input, and consider whether to allow the pilot to expire or to issue a subsequent policy to continue, modify, or make the pilot permanent.
Modified – Performance Management:
OMB Circular A-11, Part 6, Section 270 – Reporting the Results of Annual Strategic Reviews ­
Sections 270.13 and 270.17 of OMB Circular A-11, Part 6, provide guidance to agencies on meeting the GPRA Modernization Act’s requirements for reporting on the results of annual strategic reviews. Because agencies are currently developing new strategic goals and objectives that will be reflected in the update to the Agency Strategic Plan with the President’s FY 2019 Budget, agencies may forego the reporting and categorization requirements for any current strategic objectives that an agency determines will be substantively different or no longer aligned with the current Administration’s policy, legislative, regulatory or budgetary priorities. Agencies should include a progress update for any Strategic Objective identified as “Noteworthy Progress” or a “Focus Area for Improvement” as part of their progress update in their FY 2016 and FY 2017 Annual Performance Report (APR) and address performance improvement next steps as part of their FY 2018 and FY 2019 Annual Performance Plan (APP), to the extent that the agency findings from the strategic reviews conducted during the previous Administration are consistent with the policies and priorities of the current Administration. Agencies should consult with their appropriate OMB Resource Management Office in making the determination of whether their strategic objectives are aligned with the policy priorities of the current Administration. During this transition year, updates of progress on agency strategic objectives will only be published in the agency’s APR and will not be reported to Performance.gov. Full reporting through Performance.gov will resume following the publication of new Agency Strategic Plans in February 2018.
  7

Modified – Performance Management (Cont.):
Additionally, for FY 2017, OMB is pausing the FedStat and Strategic Reviews meetings that normally occur between OMB and agencies. In lieu of the FedStat and Strategic Reviews, OMB will meet with CFO Act agencies and a limited number of other agencies to discuss Agency Reform Plans, as outlined in OMB Memorandum M-17-22. While there will be no formal meetings between OMB and agencies to discuss findings from internal strategic reviews, OMB anticipates that agencies will still conduct strategic reviews or assessments of progress made towards strategic goals and objectives. Such reviews would leverage agency learning on the effectiveness of strategies to achieve desired impact since the 2014 strategic reviews, and the findings from the development of the initial Enterprise Risk Management Risk Profile would help inform both agency reform plan proposals and new strategic priorities to be reflected in agency strategic and performance planning during 2017.
OMB Circular A-11, Part 6, Sections 220 and 250 – Quarterly Reporting of Priority Goals to Performance.gov - The GPRA Modernization Act requires agencies to report quarterly updates of progress made towards achieving Priority Goals (Agency Priority Goals and Cross-Agency Priority Goals) to a centralized website: Performance.gov. These Priority Goals are intended to focus efforts toward achieving the priorities of current political leadership. Therefore, consistent with this intention, reporting on all previous Administration Priority Goals to Performance.gov is discontinued for the remainder of the performance period (through the end of FY 2017). New Priority Goals are being established for release with the President’s FY 2019 Budget. Agencies and teams working on the previous Administration’s Priority Goals should focus their efforts on furthering the work and activities of current goal strategies only where they are aligned with the policy priorities of the current Administration and report the results of progress on these shared goals in their FY 2016 and FY 2017 APRs. Agencies should consult with their appropriate OMB Resource Management Office in making the determination of whether their Priority Goals are aligned with the policy priorities of the current Administration. Agencies continue to have flexibility in structuring continued quarterly, data-driven performance reviews. These should continue where leadership can utilize the reviews as a mechanism for focusing on agency priorities, diagnosing problems, and finding opportunities for performance improvements.
Modified – Customer Service:
OMB Memorandum M-15-09, Guidance on Implementing the Federal Customer Service Awards Program (March 19, 2015), instructs Federal agencies to submit nominations for the President’s Award for Customer Service to OMB by July 31st of each year after running an agency-level awards process. Given the recent Presidential transition and agency leadership changes, most agencies will be unable to run an agency-level awards process in time to meet the nomination submission deadline this year. Thus, agencies are not required to run a process to identify and submit nominations to OMB this year for the 2017 Federal Customer Service Awards Program. The Administration plans to resume the program in 2018.
Modified – Financial Management:
Government Charge Card Reporting pursuant to Appendix B of OMB Circular A-123 – Chapter 5 of Appendix B to OMB Circular A-123 (2009) on “Statistical Reporting” in section 5.3.1 and “Narrative Reporting” in section 5.3.2 are now optional and not required to be submitted to OMB. Agencies are still required to maintain statistical and narrative information for their own use and management of their charge card program. OMB is finalizing an update to Appendix B of OMB Circular A-123 (2009). This update will streamline reporting requirements and consolidate existing requirements in a central location. In addition, agencies are still required to report purchase card violations pursuant to OMB Memorandum M­ 13-21 (Implementation of the Government Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act of 2012).
   8

Paused - Procurement:
Reporting Requirement for Conducting Acquisition Assessments under OMB Circular A-123 (May 21, 2008) - This policy memorandum requires agencies to conduct entity level internal control reviews of the acquisition function in accordance with OMB Circular A-123 and to integrate their assessment efforts with existing agency internal control processes and practices. This assessment requirement is paused through FY 2020 in order to allow agencies to instead focus their attention on reorganization planning and execution, as addressed in EO 13781, Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing The Executive Branch, and OMB Memorandum M-17-22. However, agencies may wish to refer to questions posed in the guidance to help inform their reorganization analyses.
Reporting Requirement for Circular No. A-126, Improving the Management and Use of Government Aircraft - Section 10(c) of this Circular requires agencies to provide a semi-annual summary report to OMB of non-mission travel by senior officials, members of the families of such officials, and any non- Federal travelers (except as authorized under 10 U.S.C. § 4744 and regulations implementing that statute). OMB intends to amend the Circular to eliminate this report and is pausing this requirement until the Circular can be amended. Agencies will be expected to continue reporting travel activities to GSA in accordance with the Circular.
Reporting Requirement for Circular No. A-131, Value Engineering (December 26, 2013) – revised. Section VIII of Circular A-131 requires agencies to report annually to OMB on their use of value engineering (VE) as a management tool to achieve savings through more efficient and effective agency operations. OMB intends to amend the Circular to eliminate this report and is pausing this requirement until the Circular can be amended. However, usage of VE should continue to be overseen by the agency’s senior accountable official designated in accordance with section VII, and agencies are encouraged to work with OMB on case studies to highlight successful uses of VE in the Innovation Hallway on GSA’s Acquisition Gateway.
Paused – Program Management:
Reporting Requirements under OMB Memorandum M-16-23, Prioritizing Federal Investments in Promise Zones (September 2016) - M-16-23 requires Federal agencies to identify financial assistance and other resources where preference can be appropriately offered on the basis of a Promise Zone designation and to make such preference available. More specifically, M-16-23 requires agencies to report to OMB at the beginning of each fiscal year (or within 60 days of annual appropriations) on programs that will offer preference for Promise Zones in that fiscal year, including both competitive and noncompetitive opportunities. In addition, M-16-23 requires agencies to report to OMB each November on resources awarded to Promise Zones and Promise Zone-certified entities in the prior fiscal year. OMB is suspending the requirement to report on: 1) programs offering preference through FY 2018, and 2) awards to Promise Zones and Promise Zone-certified applicants for FY 2017. OMB will resume the requirement for reporting on awards in FY 2018 and will continue to consider whether to resume reporting requirements in full for FY 2019 and beyond. All other provisions of M-16-23 remain in effect.
